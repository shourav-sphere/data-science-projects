# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains three distinct projects, each demonstrating fundamental data science techniques, insights, and analyses on real-world datasets.

## Projects Overview
This repository consists of the following projects:

### 1. Titanic Dataset Analysis
**Folder:** `titanic-survival-analysis/`

**Description:**
- Analyzes the Titanic dataset to identify factors influencing passenger survival.
- Focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

**Key Components:**
- Data loading and cleaning.
- Feature engineering (e.g., 'Number of Relatives').
- Visualization of survival patterns by age, gender, and class.

**Technologies:**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset Source:**
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

**Path:**
- `titanic-survival-analysis/README.md`

### 2. Titanic Dataset Assignment
**Folder:** `titanic_dataset_assignment/`

**Description:**
- A dedicated assignment using the Titanic dataset to create a new column and generate a scatter plot.

**Key Components:**
- Creation of a new column `Number of Relatives` defined as `SibSp + Parch`.
- Scatter plot of passengers who survived, with `Number of Relatives` on the X-axis and `Age` on the Y-axis.

**Technologies:**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset Source:**
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

**Path:**
- `titanic_dataset_assignment/README.md`

### 3. Student Performance Analysis
**Folder:** `student-performance-analysis/`

**Description:**
- Analyzes student performance across multiple assessments.
- Explores the impact of test marks, attendance, and final term scores.

**Key Components:**
- Merging multiple datasets.
- Feature engineering to calculate best and average marks.
- Application of K-Means clustering to group students based on performance.

**Technologies:**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Path:**
- `student-performance-analysis/README.md`
